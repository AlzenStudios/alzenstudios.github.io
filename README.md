# alzenstudios.github.io

official website for alzenstudios, written in raw html because right now we don't have an fully operational VPS source to host our website on,
it will be eventualy up with an dynamic based site but let's stay simple

if the site crashes don't worry is normaly because this is an static page and not fully optimized to handle such requests or stay vigilant and keep up all the time 

NOTICE: the Certificate for https may be invalid for some reason, on the official domain source i have HTTPS valid certs, but enforcing the https certificate on the static site it will make it crash, so there is nothing to worry about, all is safe there is no malicius acting behind the scenes, this site is just an placeholder, if any scanner web, for example: virustotal flags or other softwares in general, just ignore it, is an false flag
