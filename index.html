    <h1>Hello everyone, an welcoming start to Creavitiy!</h1> <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Mvoud, a 17-year-old who thinks big, with creativity constantly sparking new ideas an inventive engineer, to put it simply.</p>
    <p>To show that I'm real, this dream has become my life goal and an opportunity to become an entrepreneur.</p>

    <h3>What do I like to do?</h3>
    <p>I genuinely love programming in C# and other languages, and I also produce music.</p>
    <p>PS: I love OOP structures and static/dynamic classes basically, complex architectures.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Why does my site have a minimalistic style?</h3>
    <p>Because sophisticated sites are often blamed for AI-generated content in this era.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is the purpuse of this site?</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to explore new ideas in software and hardware, sharing updates and insights from our journey <b>without claiming anything risky or controversial</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What are the goals so far?</h3>
    <p>We are creating EngineSDK, our special software platform that will develop with us to build a dynamically based ecosystem.</p>
    <p>We will also publish the first game releases soon, so stay tuned for more information...</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>First of all, we noticed that other domains have been created with the same name as ours, apparently containing AI-generated content, which we don’t want.</p>
    <p>Companies are often created out of passion, not as a generated solution to steal other people’s dreams for profit or jealousy.</p> 
    <p>I will list the domains that are trying to do this, not to be offensive, but to reveal the real side of these people: </p>

            Seems to be a fake video-generation AI company selling suspicious lessons that are possibly a scam. 
            <b>You can also look at the design, which is not a curated design.</b> 
            They also have a YouTube channel, but don’t actually visit it or support them.
